# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Puropose:
  The purpose of this challenge was to get acclimated with SQL to create, read, update and delete information. In this particualr project we 
  created employee tables for the company Pewlett-Hackard. When created these tables we used wrote SQL code to answer questions about current employees,
  soon to retire employees and eligibilty for mentoring programs. Furthermore we extracted insights about the 'silver tsunami' to help management prepare 
  for the adjustments to come in regards to the senior-type employees.
